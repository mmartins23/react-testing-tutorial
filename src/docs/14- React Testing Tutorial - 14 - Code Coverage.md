### Code Coverage

**Code coverage** is a metric used in software testing to describe the percentage of your codebase that is executed while running automated tests. It helps in identifying untested parts of your code, ensuring that your tests comprehensively cover the codebase. The higher the coverage, the more confidence you have in the quality and reliability of your software.

### Key Concepts of Code Coverage

1. **Statements Coverage:** Measures the percentage of executed statements in your code.
2. **Branches Coverage:** Measures the percentage of executed branches in your control structures (e.g., `if` statements).
3. **Functions Coverage:** Measures the percentage of executed functions or methods.
4. **Lines Coverage:** Measures the percentage of executed lines in your code.

### Code Coverage with Jest

Jest provides built-in support for measuring code coverage. You can configure it to generate detailed coverage reports and enforce coverage thresholds to ensure a minimum level of testing.

### Using Code Coverage in Jest

#### Running Tests with Coverage

To run tests with code coverage, you can use the following npm script:

```json
"coverage": "npm test -- --coverage --watchAll"
```

- `npm test -- --coverage`: This command runs all tests and generates a code coverage report.
- `--watchAll`: This option runs Jest in watch mode, so it reruns tests whenever you make changes to the code.

#### Configuring Coverage Thresholds

Jest allows you to enforce minimum coverage thresholds for your project. This ensures that your codebase maintains a certain level of test coverage.

**Example configuration in `package.json`:**

```json
"jest": {
  "coverageThreshold": {
    "global": {
      "branches": 80,
      "functions": 80,
      "lines": 80,
      "statements": -10
    }
  }
}
```

- **`coverageThreshold`**: This option sets the minimum coverage thresholds for your tests.
  - **`global`**: Specifies global coverage thresholds for the entire codebase.
    - **`branches`**: Ensures at least 80% of branches (e.g., `if` conditions) are tested.
    - **`functions`**: Ensures at least 80% of functions are tested.
    - **`lines`**: Ensures at least 80% of lines are tested.
    - **`statements`**: This is likely a typo; it should be "statements" and typically a positive integer (e.g., `statements: 80`), ensuring at least 80% of all statements are tested.

### Running Coverage Script

To run the coverage script defined in the `package.json`, you can execute the following command:

```sh
npm run coverage
```

This command will:
1. Execute all tests.
2. Generate a code coverage report.
3. Enforce the specified coverage thresholds.
4. Run in watch mode, so it will rerun tests and update the coverage report as you make changes to the code.

### Benefits of Code Coverage

1. **Identify Gaps:** Helps identify untested parts of your code, ensuring comprehensive testing.
2. **Improve Quality:** Enforcing coverage thresholds maintains a minimum quality standard.
3. **Reduce Bugs:** More tested code means fewer chances of having undetected bugs.
4. **Continuous Improvement:** Encourages developers to write more tests and improve the coverage over time.

### Summary

Code coverage is a crucial metric for ensuring the quality and reliability of your codebase. By integrating coverage reports and enforcing coverage thresholds in your Jest configuration, you can maintain high standards for your project's test coverage, ultimately leading to more robust and maintainable software. The provided script and configuration make it easy to run tests, generate coverage reports, and ensure that your code meets the specified coverage criteria.
