### MSW Handlers in React Testing

**Mock Service Worker (MSW)** is a powerful tool for intercepting network requests in tests and returning mock data. Handlers are a core concept in MSW, allowing you to define how to intercept and respond to HTTP requests.

### Understanding MSW Handlers

- **Handlers**: These are functions that define how to intercept and respond to specific network requests.
- **Request Interception**: Handlers specify the type of request (GET, POST, etc.) and the URL pattern to intercept.
- **Response**: Handlers return a mocked response, including status code, headers, and body.

### Example Handlers File: `handlers.ts`

The provided code sets up a handler for a GET request to a specific endpoint.

```typescript
import { rest } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  rest.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      ctx.status(200),
      ctx.json([
        {
          name: 'Bruce Wayne',
        },
        {
          name: 'Clark Kent',
        },
        {
          name: 'Princess Diana',
        },
      ])
    )
  }),
]
```

#### Explanation of `handlers.ts`:

1. **Importing `rest` from `msw`**:
   - `rest` is a utility from MSW for defining request handlers.

   ```typescript
   import { rest } from 'msw'
   ```

2. **Creating an Array of Handlers**:
   - The `handlers` array contains definitions for different request handlers.

   ```typescript
   export const handlers = [
   ```

3. **Defining a GET Handler**:
   - The `rest.get` method is used to intercept GET requests to the specified URL (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`).

   ```typescript
   rest.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users', (req, res, ctx) => {
   ```

4. **Handling the Request**:
   - The handler function takes three parameters: `req`, `res`, and `ctx`.
     - `req`: The intercepted request object.
     - `res`: A function to create the mock response.
     - `ctx`: A utility for creating response data.

   ```typescript
   (req, res, ctx) => {
   ```

5. **Returning the Mock Response**:
   - `res` is called with a series of context functions (`ctx`).
   - `ctx.status(200)`: Sets the status code to 200 (OK).
   - `ctx.json([...])`: Sets the response body to a JSON array of user objects.

   ```typescript
   return res(
     ctx.status(200),
     ctx.json([
       {
         name: 'Bruce Wayne',
       },
       {
         name: 'Clark Kent',
       },
       {
         name: 'Princess Diana',
       },
     ])
   )
   ```

6. **Completing the Handler Definition**:
   - Close the handler function and the handlers array.

   ```typescript
   })
   ```

### How This Handler Works in Practice

- When your application makes a GET request to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`, MSW intercepts the request.
- Instead of the request going out to the real server, MSW returns the mock response defined in the handler.
- In this case, the response is a 200 OK status with a JSON array containing three user objects.

### Using MSW Handlers in Tests

To use these handlers in your tests, you need to set up and start the MSW server. This typically involves importing and starting the server in your test setup file.

```typescript
// src/setupTests.ts
import { server } from './mocks/server'

// Establish API mocking before all tests.
beforeAll(() => server.listen())

// Reset any request handlers that are declared as a part of our tests
// (i.e. for testing one-time error scenarios).
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())

// Clean up after the tests are finished.
afterAll(() => server.close())
```

By using handlers in MSW, you can effectively mock and test how your application handles network requests without needing access to the actual backend. This makes your tests more reliable and faster.
